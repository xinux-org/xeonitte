# Xeonitte Configuration

The Xeonitte installer is configured using YAML files, with a basic configuration looking like this:

```yml
---
distribution_name: Xinux
distribution_logo: branding/xinux/xinux.svg
branding: xinux
internet_check_url: http://nmcheck.gnome.org/check_network_status.txt
default_hostname: xinux
choices:
  - !configuration
    file: basic.yml
  - !configuration
    file: advanced.yml
  - live
```

### `distribution_name`

The name of the distribution. This is used in the installers title and welcome screen.

### `distribution_logo`

The path to the distribution logo. Currently unused.

### `branding`

The name of the branding directory. This is used to find the branding files for the installing slideshow.

### `internet_check_url`

The url to ping to check for an internet connection.

### `default_hostname`

The default hostname to use for the installation.

### `choices`

A list of configuration options to load, each option can either be a `!configuration` or `live`.

A `!configuration` option must specify a `file` to load, which is a local path to an installation configuration file. The `live` option adds a `Try {distribution name} live` option that simply quits the installer and allows the user to test the desktop.

## Installation Configurations

Installation configurations specify what steps of the installer are used. An example configuration can be found in [basic.yml](./basic.yml.in) and [basic](./basic).

```yml

  The `root` option specifies whether there should be an option to set a root password on the user configuration screen.

  The `hostname` option specifies whether there should be an option to set a hostname on the user configuration screen.

## NixOS Configurations

With each installation configuration, a set of configuration files including a `configuration.nix` file must be placed in a directory called `/etc/xeonitte/{config_id}`. The `configuration.nix` file is used to configure the installed system. The final configuration files are generated by replacing the `@OPTION@` tags in the configuration files with the options selected by the user.

Configuration snippets:

- `@BOOTLOADRER@` - Bootloader
- `@NETWORK@` - Network configuration
- `@TIMEZONE@` - Timezone
- `@LOCALE@` - Localization
- `@KEYBOARD@` - Keyboard layout
- `@AUTOLOGIN@` - Autologin config
- `@PACKAGES@` - Packages to install
- `@STATEVERSION@` - NixOS version found by running `nixos-version`

Standalone values:

- `@HOSTNAME@` - Hostname
- `@USERNAME@` - Username
- `@FULLNAME@` - A user's full name
